🕸️ Web Scraping Use Case with React, Gemini AI, and Netlify
🎯 Objective
Build a full-stack web application that:

Accepts a website URL from the user.

Scrapes all internal pages of the website.

Extracts and summarizes key sections using Gemini AI.

Scrapes the associated LinkedIn company page (Home + About sections).

Displays structured, section-wise content using a React UI hosted on Netlify.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Layer	Technology
Frontend	React (with Tailwind + ShadCN)
Backend	Node.js or Python (FastAPI/Flask)
AI	Google Gemini AI
Hosting	Netlify (Frontend), Render/Backendless Functions (Optional)
Scraping	Puppeteer or Playwright (for dynamic pages) / BeautifulSoup (static pages)

🔄 Workflow
1. User Input
User enters a URL (e.g., https://example.com).

Clicks on "Scrape & Summarize".

2. Website Scraping
Scrape the homepage and discover internal links.

Filter and group pages by intent/URL pattern:

/about → Web About

/services → Web Services

/products or /solutions → Web Products

/contact or /support → Web Contact

Footer links to X, Facebook, LinkedIn → Web Social Media

3. LinkedIn Detection & Scraping
Extract the LinkedIn URL (if available).

Navigate to the LinkedIn company page.

Scrape:

Home section: Company name, tagline, followers

About section: Description, specialties, industry, size, HQ, website, founded year

4. AI Summarization (Gemini AI)
Summarize each section:

Website Homepage

Web About

Web Services

Web Products

Web Contact

Web Social Media presence

LinkedIn Home

LinkedIn About

🧾 Output Fields & Layout (Split Sections)

⚠️ Notes
Respect LinkedIn and target website robots.txt and scraping terms.

Use Gemini AI API quotas efficiently.

Use user-agent spoofing and proxy rotation if scaling up scraping.

Would you like a starter code base (React + Netlify deployable + scraper backend) or a Figma UI mockup to begin implementation?
